## Intro

The app is a simple but useful. In this app, we use just two color (white and black), and the app only have one View to display the information about current weather condition where you are, and when you pull down, it will show the next three day’s forecast. Most important, i add the textview to allow people write something when they use this app, when they complete, the can hold and press to share from their friends. I hope customers will like my first weather app.

Now the app can download in app store, link right [here](https://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/drizzling/id1203140929?l=en&mt=8)
